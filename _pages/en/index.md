# What
We provide Government of Canada science based departments and agencies (SBDAs) a cloud space to innovate. This isn't for production science, rather, to evaluate if the cloud helps you.

We offer short term (3-9 months) cloud spaces for innovation, development, and learning; with support from our team of Cloud Evolution Sherpas.

- Azure
- AWS
- Google Cloud Platform
